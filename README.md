# expense_tracker
This is a flutter Application built with google cloud services API, gsheets and fl_chart 



Functionality:

1. In our daily life we use google sheet quite often, to track our money records and everything. So I took a very simple idea from that and built an App on top of it.
2. I found a package on pub.dev website called google cloud services which handles the google spread sheet API
3. So my main target was to control the spread sheet from the application, in order to do that, I made an API
